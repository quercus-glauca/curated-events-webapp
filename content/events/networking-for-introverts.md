## Mastering C/C++

**C++** (pronounced "C plus plus") is a high-level general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup) as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

## Philosophy

Throughout C++'s life, its development and evolution has been guided by a set of principles:

+ It must be driven by actual problems and its features should be immediately useful in real world programs.
+ Every feature should be implementable (with a reasonably obvious way to do so).
+ Programmers should be free to pick their own programming style, and that style should be fully supported by C++.
+ Allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing every possible misuse of C++.
+ It should provide facilities for organising programs into separate, well-defined parts, and provide facilities for combining separately developed parts.
+ No implicit violations of the *type system* (but allow explicit violations; that is, those explicitly requested by the programmer).
+ User-created types need to have the same support and performance as built-in types.
+ Unused features should not negatively impact created executables (e.g. in lower performance).
+ There should be no language beneath C++ (except *assembly language*).
+ C++ should work alongside other existing *programming languages*, rather than fostering its own separate and incompatible *programming environment*.
+ If the programmer's intent is unknown, allow the programmer to specify it by providing manual control.

## Language

C++ inherits most of C's syntax. The following is Bjarne Stroustrup's version of the **Hello world program** that uses the **C++ Standard Library** stream facility to write a message to *standard output*:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";
}
```

## Standardization

C++ is standardized by an [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization) working group known as [JTC1/SC22/WG21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_JTC_1/SC_22). So far, it has published six revisions of the C++ standard and is currently working on the next revision, [C++23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B23).
